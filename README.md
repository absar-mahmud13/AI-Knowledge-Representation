Here's a `README.md` and a GitHub repository structure for combining the provided files (`harry.py`, `mastermind.py`, `puzzle.py`, and `logic.py`) into a cohesive project. This setup assumes the repository is named **LogicPuzzleSolver**.

### README.md

```markdown
# LogicPuzzleSolver

LogicPuzzleSolver is a Python project for solving logical puzzles using a knowledge base and inference mechanisms. The project uses logical symbols, expressions, and model checking to represent and evaluate statements and conditions in various puzzles.

## Contents

- **`logic.py`**: Contains core classes and functions for defining logical expressions and evaluating them against a model.
- **`harry.py`**: Uses logic to solve a hypothetical Harry Potter-themed puzzle involving characters and conditions.
- **`mastermind.py`**: Implements the game logic for a Mastermind-inspired puzzle where colors must be arranged based on logical rules.
- **`puzzle.py`**: A puzzle to assign people to houses using logical constraints and rules.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LogicPuzzleSolver.git
cd LogicPuzzleSolver
```

## Usage

Each file can be run individually to solve a different puzzle. Ensure that all files are in the same directory as they import the `logic.py` file for logical operations.

### Running Puzzles

To run each puzzle, use the following commands:

```bash
python harry.py        # Solves the Harry Potter logic puzzle
python mastermind.py   # Solves the Mastermind logic puzzle
python puzzle.py       # Solves the house assignment logic puzzle
```

Each script will output logical conclusions based on the constraints and rules defined within.

## Example Output

The output of each puzzle is based on the logical deductions made. For example, running `harry.py` might produce results like whether it is raining based on character actions.

### .gitignore

Create a `.gitignore` file to ignore unnecessary files, especially if you plan to add virtual environments or other temporary files:

```
# Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]

# Virtual environment
venv/
.env/

# Distribution / packaging
build/
dist/
*.egg-info/
```

This setup provides structure and guidance on using each file, helping users understand and run the different logic puzzles in the project.
