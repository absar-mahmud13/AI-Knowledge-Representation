# AI Knowledge Representation with Logic Inference

This project demonstrates AI knowledge representation and logic inference using Python. The code uses symbols and logical constraints to model knowledge about a hypothetical game scenario (similar to "Clue") to deduce information about characters, rooms, and weapons based on known and unknown facts.

## Project Overview

This code applies principles of AI Knowledge Representation by representing characters, rooms, and weapons as symbols, and applying logical constraints to determine which symbols can be inferred to be true, false, or unknown. Inference is achieved through logical functions and constraints.

## Features

- Define symbols for various entities (characters, rooms, and weapons).
- Add logical constraints to form a knowledge base (KB).
- Use inference to deduce the truth values of different symbols.
- Display results with color-coded outputs for easier interpretation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-knowledge-representation.git
    cd ai-knowledge-representation
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed, and then install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install termcolor
    ```

    You may need a logic inference module, such as `logic.py`. If it’s a custom module, ensure it’s in the project directory.

## Usage

To run the code, execute the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The output will display symbols with a "YES" status (green), indicating known truths, and "MAYBE" for indeterminate symbols.

## Code Explanation

The code is divided into key sections:

1. **Symbol Definition**: Defines each character, room, and weapon as a symbol.
2. **Knowledge Base (KB) Construction**: Adds constraints to represent known facts (e.g., certain characters, rooms, or weapons may or may not be in the solution).
3. **Inference Function**: Uses `model_check()` to determine the truth value of each symbol based on the KB. Outputs are color-coded:
   - **Green (YES)**: Indicates a certain true symbol.
   - **MAYBE**: The symbol’s truth value cannot be definitively determined.

4. **Sample Code Explanation**: Check the source code for comments explaining each section of logic, symbol setup, and inference.

## Sample Output

Sample output based on current constraints:
```
MsScarlet: YES
library: YES
knife: YES
ProfPlum: MAYBE
ballroom: MAYBE
```

Here, symbols marked "YES" have been inferred to be true based on the knowledge base, while "MAYBE" means the inference couldn’t determine their status.
